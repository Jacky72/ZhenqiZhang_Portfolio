# ZhenqiZhang_Portfolio

A Personal Portfolio Project to expand my knowledge with Next.js

This is a project that I developed by following a tutorial video on YouTube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb1f5bvF6f4&t=6202s&ab_channel=webdecoded)

I took a lot of inspiration from the video but also changed it up a bit to suit my needs.

The purpose of this project is to explore Next.js/React and create a personal portfolio that others can view.

Wish you a fun time exploring my website.
