# ZhenqiZhang_Portfolio

A Personal Portfolio Project to expand my knowledge with Next.js

This is a project that I developed by following tutorial video on Youtube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb1f5bvF6f4&t=6202s&ab_channel=webdecoded)

I took a lot of reference from the video but also changed it up a bit to turn it to what I wanted.

The purpose of this project is just to explore Next.js/React and also creating a personal portfolio for myself which others can then view.

Wish you have a fun time exploring my website.
